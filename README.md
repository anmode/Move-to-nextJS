## üß™ Prettier lint test and How to fix it?
Prettier is a code formatter that helps maintain consistent code style and formatting in your projects. It automatically analyzes your code and applies predefined formatting rules to ensure a standardized appearance.

Linting is the process of analyzing code for potential errors, bugs, and code style violations. It helps identify and highlight problematic code patterns, potential bugs, and adherence to coding standards.

<b>"Prettier lint test" </b> refers to running a linter (such as ESLint) with the Prettier plugin or rules enabled. It means checking your code for both linting errors and code formatting inconsistencies according to Prettier's rules.

To fix Prettier linting issues, you can follow these steps:

1) Install necessary tools: Ensure that you have the required tools installed in your project. You'll need ESLint and Prettier, along with any additional plugins or configurations specific to your project or coding environment.
```bash
npm install eslint prettier --save-dev
```
2) Configure ESLint: Set up your ESLint configuration file (.eslintrc.js or .eslintrc.json) to include Prettier rules and the Prettier plugin. This allows ESLint to use Prettier's formatting rules for linting.
```bash
module.exports = {
  // Other ESLint rules and configurations
  extends: ['eslint:recommended', 'plugin:prettier/recommended'],
};
```
Make sure the Prettier plugin is included in the extends array.

3) Configure Prettier: Create a Prettier configuration file (.prettierrc or prettier.config.js) in the root of your project. Define your preferred formatting rules and options for Prettier.
``` bash
module.exports = {
  // Prettier options
};
```
Customize the Prettier options according to your desired code formatting style.
4)  Run ESLint with Prettier: Execute the ESLint command to lint your code and fix any issues related to code formatting according to Prettier's rules.
```bash
npx eslint --fix .
```
The --fix flag automatically fixes fixable issues, including formatting inconsistencies
